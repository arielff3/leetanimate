## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Input validation
const validateInput = (input) => {
  if (typeof input !== 'string' || input.length > 1000) {
    throw new Error('Invalid input');
  }
  return input.trim();
};

// ❌ Avoid - Direct DOM manipulation without sanitization
element.innerHTML = userInput; // Dangerous!
```

### Dependencies

- 🔍 **Audit Regularly**: Run `npm audit` before commits
- 📦 **Update Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date
- 🚫 **Avoid Risky Packages**: Research packages before adding
- 🔒 **Lock Versions**: Use exact versions in package-lock.json

### Environment Variables

- 🔐 **No Secrets in Code**: Never commit secrets or API keys
- 📝 **Use .env Files**: Store configuration in environment files
- 🚫 **Don't Commit .env**: Add .env to .gitignore
- 🔒 **Validate Environment**: Validate required environment variables
